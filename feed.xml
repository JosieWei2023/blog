<p>During a department meeting, a male leader inquired about my relationship status. Upon learning I had a boyfriend, he half-jokingly remarked, &quot;You do realize that in our department, the approval of female staff's partners has to go through me, right?&quot;</p>
<p>No one present identified this as sexual harassment. In fact, some perceived him as showing genuine concern for his subordinates.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment is a term with a specific definition. As Ueno Chizuko, a feminist scholar, points out, the ongoing effort of feminists is to define such terms.</p>
<p>It's only with an understanding of concepts like &quot;sexual harassment&quot; and &quot;domestic violence&quot; that one can recognize them in reality. Years later, equipped with this knowledge, I can now reinterpret past experiences, realizing that the discomfort I felt was indeed sexual harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Emotions remain unformed experiences until articulated. They cannot be expressed otherwise.</strong></p>
<p>I recently read &quot;Ueno-Sensei, Would You Teach Me Feminism from Scratch?&quot;， co-authored by Ueno Chizuko and Tabata Yasuko. It cleared up a long-standing confusion of mine: My closest friends have usually not been straight men.</p>
<p>Friend X explained: Women and gay individuals, being marginalized in an unequal power structure, are compelled to reflect more deeply, leading to shared perspectives.</p>
<p>The book introduced me to the concept of society and individuals having two facets: the A-side and the B-side. The A-side represents the public, market realm, typically occupied by adult men, while the B-side symbolizes the private, domestic sphere.</p>
<p>Women, initially part of the A-side, often transition to the B-side due to childbirth and childcare. The A-side reflects one's social persona, whereas the B-side represents one's unique, personal identity.</p>
<p>This B-side aligns with what X and I describe as an &quot;inner standing&quot; – a more private dimension not exclusive to, but more pronounced in, women and gay individuals. In a patriarchal society focused on the A-side, they often endure oppression, being labeled as irrational or emotional.</p>
<p>Lately, the rise of gender conflicts online has piqued my interest in feminism. Dense theoretical works are challenging to digest; even the &quot;Feminism&quot; book my sister brought home put me to sleep at the preface. However, &quot;Feminism from Scratch,&quot; being dialogue-based, was more accessible, offering both resonance and theoretical insights.</p>
<p>I believe that discussions should extend beyond mere agreement. Conversations with X are enriching, as they blend criticism with scholarly references and theoretical explanations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I consider the common topic among housewives – criticizing husbands – rather superficial. It's more insightful to explore the reasons behind such comments and our reactions to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd like to share some enlightening ideas from this book by addressing three questions featured on its cover.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is Feminism?</li>
</ol>
<p>Professor Ueno sees feminism as diverse and inclusive. She asserts that feminism is a self-identifying concept; anyone who claims to be a feminist is one. This is because feminism encompasses complex issues that defy simple answers, such as whether it's good or bad for women to work while raising children, or if women should participate in warfare. These debates reflect feminism's willingness to engage in controversy.</p>
<p>When witnessing debates on Chinese social media platforms like Douban and Weibo, I often see more malice than progress. The constant negation – claiming &quot;this is not feminism&quot; or &quot;this person doesn't deserve to be a feminist&quot; – seems to narrow our own standing. For instance, the cyberbullying of Papi Jiang for giving her child her husband's surname, labeling her as a &quot;marriage donkey,&quot; reflects this.</p>
<p>A term called &quot;<strong>weakness phobia</strong>&quot; encapsulates the reluctance of women, once assimilated into mainstream (A-side) society, to acknowledge their own weaknesses or tolerate perceived weakness in others, often leading to disgust.</p>
<p><strong>Misogyny manifests in men as contempt for women and in women as self-loathing.</strong></p>
<p>Thus, for women, feminism is an ideology that encourages embracing and loving their female identity.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Why Do We Need Feminism?</li>
</ol>
<p>Professor Ueno, in her University of Tokyo lecture, clarified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feminism is not about the weak striving to become strong. It's about ensuring respect for the weak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since people understand others through their own experiences, men often misconstrue women's advocacy for rights as a desire to become like men – a limitation of male imagination.</p>
<p>The privileged often don't need to empathize with the less privileged, leading to insensitivity in certain situations.</p>
<p>At my previous job, my boss asked me to dress up for a bank event with drinks. I was outraged, but he dismissed it as normal. When I questioned if he'd want his daughter to do the same, he became furious.</p>
<p>To him, his daughter was a family member, a possession. Men often only recognize gender discrimination when it affects their own possessions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When explaining sexual violence, we often urge men to imagine their girlfriend or daughter as the victim. I find this approach peculiar. Why not imagine the anguish of being assaulted themselves, instead of transforming the victim into 'a woman close to them'? It’s a strange and limited perspective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the A-side society, women are often viewed merely as possessions of men. This mindset only provokes anger over possessions being harmed.</p>
<p>Why is the concept of feminism necessary? It's because unless the marginalized group (Side B) voices their demands, the dominant group (Side A) is unlikely to engage with them proactively. Being in the dominant group is advantageous, and those who benefit from this system are not inclined to relinquish their privileges voluntarily.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>How can we apply feminist thinking?</li>
</ol>
<p>The first chapter of this book is titled &quot;<em>Why are Women's Lives so Hard?</em>&quot;</p>
<p>In this chapter, Professors Ueno and Tan discuss their conflicts of values with their mothers.</p>
<p>Professor Ueno recalls how her mother had two expectations for her: to master a skill and to marry and have children. It seems her mother was projecting onto her daughter the life she never lived and the choices she abandoned. The expectation of marriage and children, perhaps, was her mother's way of hoping her daughter would validate her own life choices.</p>
<p><strong>—I received the same expectations from my mother.</strong></p>
<p>It appears that both mothers and daughters tend to impose their own life experiences on each other, a dynamic not commonly seen between mothers and sons.</p>
<p>If most women and mothers experience such value conflicts, it's not just an issue of individual personality traits of mothers, but also a reflection of the societal challenges they faced. This goes beyond a mere parent-child conflict; it's indicative of broader issues in feminism and gender discrimination.</p>
<p>Professor Ueno points out that without a specific discourse, people struggle to articulate their experiences.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the early gay community's distinction between the &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; roles. The &quot;bottom&quot; was perceived as the one adopting the female role in the relationship.</p>
<p>It's intriguing to question why, even in homosexual relationships, there was a need to artificially create a &quot;female&quot; role. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This stems from our reference point being predominantly heterosexual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, in both gay and lesbian relationships, role divisions are fading, indicating a new interpretation and definition of these relationships.</p>
<p>A striking term used in this book is &quot;<em>one person, one kill</em>&quot; a phrase borrowed from right-wing rhetoric. <strong>It conveys the idea that even if one cannot change society as a whole, one should aim to change at least one person in their lifetime.</strong></p>
<p>Feminism is not just about securing societal rights for women; it's equally vital in personal domains like marriage or relationships. The personal is political; societal change can begin with altering the viewpoints of boyfriends or husbands.</p>
<p>The thought of dedicating one's life to changing just one person is profoundly moving.</p>

<p><em>Written in Feb, 2023</em></p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's due to frequently sharing my personal journey in videos, but recently, I've been getting private messages from people. They typically start by laying out their life stories, then, cutting straight to the chase, they ask: &quot;Do you think I'm fit to go abroad?&quot;</p>
<p>I've never been one to direct others in their life choices. After all, if I'm unsure of the right path myself, how can I advise anyone else?</p>
<p>Let me explain: I create videos mainly because I love to talk. More so, I aim to demonstrate how an ordinary woman, who once blindly followed the flow, immersing herself in studies and job hunting, can find a way to live when she no longer wishes to work.</p>
<p><strong>My intent is to show, not to tell.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps my videos might inspire someone: To discover that life can be lived differently.</p>
<p>But I genuinely have no desire to dictate others' choices. After all, how can anyone presume to find life's answers from someone else?</p>
<p>I recall moving to Shanghai after graduating. My salary was modest then (and didn't improve much later). I lived in a small, restructured room in a resettlement building.</p>
<p>My living space was cramped. I had to manage with a foldable table for meals and workouts, using it as a dining table or clearing it for a yoga mat.</p>
<p>With no balcony, my freshly laundered clothes would hang in the bay window, dampening the room, especially during Shanghai's humid winters, making my bed feel almost drenched.</p>
<p>Bathing in the cold required using a bathroom heater. Occasionally, excessive electricity use would cause a power outage mid-shower, leaving me waiting silently in the dark for a neighbor to restore the power.</p>
<p>In December 2017, as Beijing addressed the issue of partitioned housing, many found themselves homeless overnight. Watching this unfold from Shanghai, I would lie awake, tears streaming down my face, pondering my fate if I were in their shoes.</p>
<p>What are we truly living for?</p>
<p><strong>Each day, I felt like I was floating in limbo, having moved to a big city, staying in a modest rental, convincing myself that all my current struggles were for a future goal.</strong></p>
<p>I believed in hard work, knowing that without effort, my future aspirations would remain unfulfilled. Every present moment seemed insignificant, merely a stepping stone to my ultimate aim.</p>
<p>Recently, while studying single linked lists, I gleaned an insight: In both linked lists and life, the only thing we truly control is the 'current' node.</p>
<p>The future is a mystery, akin to driving in the dark.</p>
<p>Each of us navigates through life, traversing node by node.</p>
<p>Once you understand the value of each node, the linked list that is life reaches its conclusion, by which time the paths to our past have long faded.</p>
<p>Life, much like a single linked list, doesn't offer second chances. This is why I constantly remind myself: Life comes with singular possibilities, and every path demands its own sacrifice.</p>
<h2><strong>人生就像条链表</strong></h2>
<p>不知道是不是老在视频里分享我的心路历程，最近时不时有人私聊我，先是啪一下把自己的背景条件罗列一番，然后白刀子进红刀子出，直接结尾来一句：您看我这样适合出国吗？</p>
<p>我一向是无意指导他人的人生。我又不知道什么是正确的道路，又凭什么指导任何人呢。</p>
<p>怎么说呢，我做视频吧，主要是因为我话唠。然后呢，其实也想展示一下，一个一直随大流，埋头读书、找工作的普通女性，突然不想上班了还能怎样继续去生活。</p>
<p>Just want to show, not to tell. </p>
<p>可能我的视频会鼓舞到一些人呢：原来人也可以这样生活。</p>
<p>但我的确不想指导别人怎么做选择啦。道路问题，怎么能妄想从他人身上找到答案呢。</p>
<p>记得大学毕业去上海，那会工资也不高（后面也不高），租在拆迁安置房改装的隔断房里。</p>
<p>我的起居室特别小，吃饭的时候把桌子摆出来，锻炼时就把桌子收起来再铺上瑜伽垫。</p>
<p>也没有阳台，衣服洗完就晾在飘窗上，湿漉漉的衣服恰逢上海湿漉漉的冬天，睡觉时感觉被窝都在滴水。</p>
<p>天冷的时候洗澡需要开浴霸，有时候用电量过大，洗到一半就跳闸了。然后我就在浴室的黑暗中静静等着邻居去把电闸拉上去。</p>
<p>17年12月那会吧，北京整治隔断房，很多人在深夜的街头无家可归。我在上海看着新闻就望着天花板流泪，想着，如果是我碰上了这样的事情怎么办呢。</p>
<p>人活着到底为了什么。</p>
<p>每天好像悬浮在空中一样，来到大城市，住着简陋的出租屋，告诉自己，我现在忍受的一切都是为了未来的某一个目标。</p>
<p>我要努力去做，不做，未来就达不到。当下的每一天都没有意义，都只是手段而已。</p>
<p>最近在学单链表，还悟出了些许道理：对于链表和人生，我们唯一能掌握的就是current这个节点。</p>
<p>未来在何方，没人能看清，仿佛在夜间开车一般。</p>
<p>每个人都只能用自己的一生向前去遍历节点。</p>
<p>当你知道所有节点的值的时候，人生这条linkedlist也就到头了，而我们早已丢失了所有通往过去的索引。</p>
<p>人生和单链表一样，没办法再来一次。所以我时刻提醒自己：生活只有一种可能性，并且没有一种生活不需要付出代价。</p>
