# [The Woman Who Wears Size 41 Shoes](https://github.com/JosieWei2023/blog/issues/9)

That's me. Haha.

I first became aware of my body size in kindergarten. After a physical examination, the teacher told me I was exceptionally tall.

Coming home, my mom jokingly said I must have consumed too much of the 'red heart king' (a kind of tonic, once very popular in China).

Reflecting on it now, it seems odd to define a woman's height as 'exceptionally tall'. Surely, one would need to be as tall as Yao Ming to be considered extraordinarily tall. By today's standards, I am just slightly taller than the average woman.

During primary school, I lived with my grandmother in my hometown. She was economical, and on rare occasions when we had fish, my sister and I competed for every bite. For fairness while eating chicken feet, we judged our shares based on the bones we spat out, not knowing she swallowed hers in secret.

It seems like fruits were a luxury, only enjoyed at home during the Spring Festival. I often visited a wealthy classmate's house to eat exotic fruits like mangosteen and cherries, while my sister sneakily ate the oranges hidden in our grandmother's closet.

My growth in height stalled during those years. Returning to my parents in junior high, I was diagnosed with moderate malnutrition.

However, my feet, oblivious to my nutritional status, continued to grow. By fifth grade, I was already shopping for size 37 shoes in adult stores.

With a sudden spurt in height during junior high, my feet grew even longer. At that time, the largest size in most women's shoe stores was 38. I recall my mom and I biking down Zhongshan Road, inquiring in each store, "Do you have size 39 shoes?"

There were times when I couldn't find fitting shoes, and my mom suggested squeezing into smaller ones, hoping they wouldn't grow further.

I used to be ashamed of my large feet, viewing it as a flaw. For a long time, my feet were a source of embarrassment.

Now, I see the criticism of women for being tall or having developed limbs as another form of oppression, pushing the stereotype of a delicate and frail female.

Back then, unaware of this, I forced my feet into all sorts of ill-fitting shoes.

This led to my toes becoming deformed.

For many years, I avoided sandals, fearing judgment for my unattractive feet.

I used to worry about being rejected for my feet if I ever got married.

One day, I had an epiphany. If my toes are deformed, so be it. It doesn't harm anyone. If I feel like wearing flip-flops, I will.

Wearing them in public, I realized people rarely stared at my feet. Yet, I found myself admiring other women's round, unblemished toes, envying their freedom from distortion.

On a trip to England, I was pleasantly surprised to find shoe sizes on the shelves that matched mine. Typically, only the most popular sizes are displayed.

Thus, my large feet aren't that unusual. In fact, they are quite average for British women.

I now understand the absurdity of the distortions and torments I endured over the years, rooted in an unspoken inferiority complex.

I've fully embraced myself now. Big or small, feet are just a matter of shoe size. The opinions of others, for the most part, are irrelevant. I joyfully shop for my large-size women's shoes or men's sports shoes on Taobao.

My feet, content and free, have quietly grown another size.
