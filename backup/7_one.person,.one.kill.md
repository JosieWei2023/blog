# [one person, one kill](https://github.com/JosieWei2023/blog/issues/7)

During a department meeting, a male leader inquired about my relationship status. Upon learning I had a boyfriend, he half-jokingly remarked, "You do realize that in our department, the approval of female staff's partners has to go through me, right?"

No one present identified this as sexual harassment. In fact, some perceived him as showing genuine concern for his subordinates.

Sexual harassment is a term with a specific definition. As Ueno Chizuko, a feminist scholar, points out, the ongoing effort of feminists is to define such terms.

It's only with an understanding of concepts like "sexual harassment" and "domestic violence" that one can recognize them in reality. Years later, equipped with this knowledge, I can now reinterpret past experiences, realizing that the discomfort I felt was indeed sexual harassment.


**Emotions remain unformed experiences until articulated. They cannot be expressed otherwise.**


I recently read "Ueno-Sensei, Would You Teach Me Feminism from Scratch?"， co-authored by Ueno Chizuko and Tabata Yasuko. It cleared up a long-standing confusion of mine: My closest friends have usually not been straight men.

Friend X explained: Women and gay individuals, being marginalized in an unequal power structure, are compelled to reflect more deeply, leading to shared perspectives.

The book introduced me to the concept of society and individuals having two facets: the A-side and the B-side. The A-side represents the public, market realm, typically occupied by adult men, while the B-side symbolizes the private, domestic sphere.

Women, initially part of the A-side, often transition to the B-side due to childbirth and childcare. The A-side reflects one's social persona, whereas the B-side represents one's unique, personal identity.

This B-side aligns with what X and I describe as an "inner standing" – a more private dimension not exclusive to, but more pronounced in, women and gay individuals. In a patriarchal society focused on the A-side, they often endure oppression, being labeled as irrational or emotional.

Lately, the rise of gender conflicts online has piqued my interest in feminism. Dense theoretical works are challenging to digest; even the "Feminism" book my sister brought home put me to sleep at the preface. However, "Feminism from Scratch," being dialogue-based, was more accessible, offering both resonance and theoretical insights.

I believe that discussions should extend beyond mere agreement. Conversations with X are enriching, as they blend criticism with scholarly references and theoretical explanations.

> I consider the common topic among housewives – criticizing husbands – rather superficial. It's more insightful to explore the reasons behind such comments and our reactions to them.

I'd like to share some enlightening ideas from this book by addressing three questions featured on its cover.

1. What is Feminism?

Professor Ueno sees feminism as diverse and inclusive. She asserts that feminism is a self-identifying concept; anyone who claims to be a feminist is one. This is because feminism encompasses complex issues that defy simple answers, such as whether it's good or bad for women to work while raising children, or if women should participate in warfare. These debates reflect feminism's willingness to engage in controversy.

When witnessing debates on Chinese social media platforms like Douban and Weibo, I often see more malice than progress. The constant negation – claiming "this is not feminism" or "this person doesn't deserve to be a feminist" – seems to narrow our own standing. For instance, the cyberbullying of Papi Jiang for giving her child her husband's surname, labeling her as a "marriage donkey," reflects this.

A term called "**weakness phobia**" encapsulates the reluctance of women, once assimilated into mainstream (A-side) society, to acknowledge their own weaknesses or tolerate perceived weakness in others, often leading to disgust.

**Misogyny manifests in men as contempt for women and in women as self-loathing.**

Thus, for women, feminism is an ideology that encourages embracing and loving their female identity.

2. Why Do We Need Feminism?

Professor Ueno, in her University of Tokyo lecture, clarified:

> Feminism is not about the weak striving to become strong. It's about ensuring respect for the weak.

Since people understand others through their own experiences, men often misconstrue women's advocacy for rights as a desire to become like men – a limitation of male imagination.

The privileged often don't need to empathize with the less privileged, leading to insensitivity in certain situations.

At my previous job, my boss asked me to dress up for a bank event with drinks. I was outraged, but he dismissed it as normal. When I questioned if he'd want his daughter to do the same, he became furious.

To him, his daughter was a family member, a possession. Men often only recognize gender discrimination when it affects their own possessions.

> When explaining sexual violence, we often urge men to imagine their girlfriend or daughter as the victim. I find this approach peculiar. Why not imagine the anguish of being assaulted themselves, instead of transforming the victim into 'a woman close to them'? It’s a strange and limited perspective.

In the A-side society, women are often viewed merely as possessions of men. This mindset only provokes anger over possessions being harmed.

Why is the concept of feminism necessary? It's because unless the marginalized group (Side B) voices their demands, the dominant group (Side A) is unlikely to engage with them proactively. Being in the dominant group is advantageous, and those who benefit from this system are not inclined to relinquish their privileges voluntarily.

3. How can we apply feminist thinking?

The first chapter of this book is titled "*Why are Women's Lives so Hard?*"

In this chapter, Professors Ueno and Tan discuss their conflicts of values with their mothers.

Professor Ueno recalls how her mother had two expectations for her: to master a skill and to marry and have children. It seems her mother was projecting onto her daughter the life she never lived and the choices she abandoned. The expectation of marriage and children, perhaps, was her mother's way of hoping her daughter would validate her own life choices.

**—I received the same expectations from my mother.**

It appears that both mothers and daughters tend to impose their own life experiences on each other, a dynamic not commonly seen between mothers and sons.

If most women and mothers experience such value conflicts, it's not just an issue of individual personality traits of mothers, but also a reflection of the societal challenges they faced. This goes beyond a mere parent-child conflict; it's indicative of broader issues in feminism and gender discrimination.

Professor Ueno points out that without a specific discourse, people struggle to articulate their experiences.

Take, for example, the early gay community's distinction between the "top" and "bottom" roles. The "bottom" was perceived as the one adopting the female role in the relationship.

It's intriguing to question why, even in homosexual relationships, there was a need to artificially create a "female" role. 

> This stems from our reference point being predominantly heterosexual.

Now, in both gay and lesbian relationships, role divisions are fading, indicating a new interpretation and definition of these relationships.

A striking term used in this book is "*one person, one kill*" a phrase borrowed from right-wing rhetoric. **It conveys the idea that even if one cannot change society as a whole, one should aim to change at least one person in their lifetime.**

Feminism is not just about securing societal rights for women; it's equally vital in personal domains like marriage or relationships. The personal is political; societal change can begin with altering the viewpoints of boyfriends or husbands.

The thought of dedicating one's life to changing just one person is profoundly moving.
