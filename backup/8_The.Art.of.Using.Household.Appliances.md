I've always thought my mom's method of using the washing machine was quite unique.

She begins by stuffing clothes into the washing machine and activating the stain removal cycle. Before the machine starts its rinse cycle, she intervenes just in time, manually rinsing the clothes after removing them.

Finally, she returns the now suds-free clothes to the washing machine for the spin dry cycle.

What should be a simple laundry routine ends up with several extra steps.

The reason is the washing machine consumes three loads of water for a full cycle: one for the wash – quite efficient and cleans well – but two for rinsing, which seems wasteful. Hence, manual rinsing is employed as a more water-efficient method!

Just tonight, in a conversation with a friend, I discovered her family also follows this washing ritual. I think that Swedish environmental activist girl could learn a thing or two from our moms...

Friend: My dad turns off the home router every night before bed, believing it prolongs its life.

Me: Routers have a lifespan?

(I've never had a router break on me... perhaps because I move quite often)

Friend: He also believes that if the internet is slow, it's a sign that the router is overworked and needs a rest.

Me: If my work slows down, my boss just accuses me of not putting in enough effort. Seems like your router is more appreciated than I am.
