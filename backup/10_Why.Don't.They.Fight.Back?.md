# [Why Don't They Fight Back?](https://github.com/JosieWei2023/blog/issues/10)

###### Written in May, 2023

There are some really annoying people on the internet.

The recent sexual harassment incidents involving young women by vile individuals like Fan Xin and Shi Hang have become a trending topic. I've been following many young people's submissions and comments on this issue.

Those men who fear being accused under the #MeToo movement are not worth mentioning. It's like saying a flawless egg won't attract flies. Besides, the chance of men being falsely accused is significantly lower than the likelihood of women facing sexual harassment. Much lower!

There are some women who, in these circumstances, claim they can't empathize with victims who don't fight back. 
> In my life, I've faced men with ill intentions too, but I've always stood my ground. Either the men gave up, or I fought back. In essence, I remained unaffected by the mire. Thus, I find it hard to sympathize with those women who are harassed but too scared to confront their harassers.

**(Subtext: They had it coming)**

When you think saying "no" is easy, consider the support you've had from your upbringing, family, education, and resources. You are indeed very fortunate in this regard.

One afternoon in 2017, around three o'clock, my boss suddenly called me to the office and told me to head to Lhasa that day. (Background: Our company is based in Shanghai)

I was shocked, as if being told to go downstairs for ramen rather than traveling to Lhasa. But I couldn't voice my confusion. I packed my backpack, bought a flight to Lhasa with a layover in Zhengzhou, departing in the evening.

At Hongqiao Airport before departure, I frantically called hotels asking, "Do you provide VAT invoices for accommodation?"

I reached Xinzheng Airport late at night and quickly slept at the hotel, needing to wake up early for the Zhengzhou to Lhasa flight the next day.

I was told it was a business trip, but upon arrival in Lhasa, my boss simply said, "Stay here."

......

That half-year was excruciating. While some might thrive in such situations, I felt incredibly isolated, as if alone in the city.

I spent my days dusting the office desk, ensuring water supply, running errands at government offices, and even fixing internet issues.

Liu Yu, a writer, once said one should be like a team. I felt like a one-person company.

I didn't dare speak up. I secretly asked my boss if I could return to Shanghai, but with no response, I stayed.

Back then, having been employed for less than a year and lacking experience, it was daunting to consider quitting. Resigning meant relying on my meager savings. Prolonged hotel stays during business trips were draining my finances.

I was afraid to quit, even hoping for a promotion in this company.

I understand why it's hard to say "no." It takes courage, and not everyone has that luxury.

For me, the worst was losing my job. For them, facing industry big shots, it could mean being blacklisted. Where would they find work then?

I've since left the country, but looking back at 2017, I doubt I'd know the right answer. Discussing going abroad is futile without money. Many questions remain unanswered, and these are just my thoughts.

**People interpret others through their experiences, and the strong often lack the need for empathy towards the weak.**

But as women, we should use our fortune and abilities to support those who can't or don't know how to fight back, not flaunt our superiority by claiming an inability to empathize.
